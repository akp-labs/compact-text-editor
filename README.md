# Compact Text Editor

A lightweight, browser-based text editor built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is for quick note-taking and text formatting. Save your work instantly as HTML with one click. 
Designed as a compact, dependency-free writing tool with rich-text formatting, live word/character counting, and offline usability.
Features include bold, italics, underline, code blocks, superscript/subscript, text color, font size, alignment options, and live word/character counters.


This project focuses on simplicity, portability, and direct DOM-based text manipulation without external libraries or frameworks.

⚠️ Note: This is a client-side editor intended for personal, educational, and experimental use. It does not aim to replace full-scale word processors.
